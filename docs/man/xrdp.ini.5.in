\fBxrdp.ini\fR \- Configuration file for \fBxrdp\fR(8)

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the man page for \fBxrdp.ini\fR, \fBxrdp\fR(8) configuration file.
It is composed by a number of sections, each one composed by a section name, enclosed by square brackets, followed by a list of \fI<parameter>\fR=\fI<value>\fR lines.

\fBxrdp.ini\fR supports the following sections:

.TP
\fB[Globals]\fP \- sets some global configuration settings for \fBxrdp\fR(8).

.TP
\fB[Logging]\fP \- logging subsystem parameters

.TP

.SH "GLOBALS"
The options to be specified in the \fB[Globals]\fR section are the following:

.TP
\fBautorun\fP=\fIsession_name\fP
Section name for automatic login. If set and the client supplies valid
username and password, the user will be logged in automatically using the
connection specified by \fIsession_name\fP.

If \fIsession_name\fP is empty, the \fBLOGIN DOMAIN\fR from the client
with be used to select the section. If no domain name is supplied, the
first suitable section will be used for automatic login.

.TP
\fBcrypt_level\fP=\fI[low|medium|high|fips]\fP
.\" <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/openspecification/archive/2011/12/08/encryption-negotiation-in-rdp-connection.aspx>
Regulate encryption level of Standard RDP Security.
This parameter is effective only if \fBsecurity_layer\fP is set to \fBrdp\fP or \fBnegotiate\fP.

Encryption in Standard RDP Security is controlled by two settings: \fIEncryption Level\fP
and \fIEncryption Method\fP.  The only supported \fIEncryption Method\fP are \fB40BIT_ENCRYPTION\fP
and \fB128BIT_ENCRYPTION\fP. \fB56BIT_ENCRYPTION\fP is not supported.
This option controls the \fIEncryption Level\fP:
.RS 8
.TP
.B low
All data sent from the client to the server is protected by encryption based on
the maximum key strength supported by the client.
.I This is the only level that the traffic sent by the server to client is not encrypted.
.TP
.B medium
All data sent between the client and the server is protected by encryption based on
the maximum key strength supported by the client (client compatible).
.TP
.B high
All data sent between the client and the server is protected by encryption based on
the server's maximum key strength (sever compatible).
.TP
.B fips
All data sent between the client and server is protected using Federal Information
Processing Standard 140-1 validated encryption methods.
.I This level is required for Windows clients (mstsc.exe) if the client's group policy
.I enforces FIPS-compliance mode.
.RE

.TP
\fBfork\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP

Specifying only the port means that xrdp will listen on all interfaces.
The default port for RDP is \fB3389\fP.
Multiple address:port instances must be separated by spaces or commas. Check the .ini file for examples.
Specifying interfaces requires said interfaces to be UP before xrdp starts.

.TP
\fBrequire_credentials\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP
If set to \fB1\fP, \fBtrue\fP or \fByes\fP, \fBxrdp\fP will scan the user name provided by the

defaults to \fBfalse\fP.

.TP
\domain_user_separator\fP=\separator\fP
If specified the domain name supplied by the client is appended to the username separated
by \fBseparator\fP.

.TP
\enable_token_login\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP
If set to \fB1\fP, \fBtrue\fP or \fByes\fP, \fBxrdp\fP requires clients to include username and
password initial connection phase. In other words, xrdp doesn't allow clients to show login
screen if set to true. If not specified, defaults to \fBfalse\fP.

.TP
\fBsecurity_layer\fP=\fI[tls|rdp|negotiate]\fP
Regulate security methods. If not specified, defaults to \fBnegotiate\fP.

.RE

.TP
\fBssl_protocols\fP=\fI[SSLv3] [TLSv1] [TLSv1.1] [TLSv1.2] [TLSv1.3]\fP
Enables the specified SSL/TLS protocols. Each value should be separated by comma.
SSLv2 is always disabled. At least one protocol should be given to accept TLS connections.
This parameter is effective only if \fBsecurity_layer\fP is set to \fBtls\fP or \fBnegotiate\fP.

.TP
\fBtcp_keepalive\fP=\fI[true|false]\fP
Regulate if the listening socket uses socket option \fBSO_KEEPALIVE\fP.

.SH "CHANNELS"
The Remote Desktop Protocol supports several channels, which are used to transfer additional data like sound, clipboard data and others.
Channel names not listed here will be blocked by \fBxrdp\fP.
Not all channels are supported in all cases, so setting a value to \fItrue\fP is a prerequisite, but does not force its use.
.br
Channels can also be enabled or disabled on a per connection basis by prefixing each setting with \fBchannel.\fP in the channel section.

.SH "CONNECTIONS"
A connection section is made of a section name, enclosed in square brackets, and the following entries:

.TP
\fBname\fR=\fI<session name>\fR
The name displayed in \fBxrdp\fR(8) login window's combo box.

.TP
\fBlib\fR=\fI../vnc/libvnc.so\fR
Sets the library to be used with this connection.

.TP
\fBusername\fR=\fI<username>\fR|\fI{base64}<base64-encoded-username>\fR|\fIask\fR
Specifies the username used for authenticating in the connection.
If set to \fIask\fR, user name should be provided in the login window.

If the username includes comment out symbols such as '#', or ';', the username can be
provided in base64 form prefixing "{base64}".

.TP
\fBpassword\fR=\fI<password>\fR|\fI{base64}<base64-encoded-password>\fR|\fIask\fR
Specifies the password used for authenticating in the connection.
If set to \fIask\fR, password should be provided in the login window.

This parameter can be provided in base64 form as well as username. See also examples below.

.TP
\fBip\fR=\fI127.0.0.1\fR
Specifies the ip address of the host to connect to.

.TP
\fBport\fR=\fI<number>\fR|\fI\-1\fR
Specifies the port number to connect to. If set to \fI\-1\fR, the default port for the specified library is used.

.TP
\fBxserverbpp\fR=\fI<number>\fR
Specifies color depth of the backend X server. The default is the color
depth of the client. Only Xvnc and X11rdp use that setting. Xorg runs at
\fI24\fR bpp.

.TP
\fBdisabled_encodings_mask\fR=\fI<number>\fR
Set this bitmask to a non-zero value to prevent \fBxrdp\fR(8) requesting
some features from the Xvnc server. You should only need to set this
to  a non-zero value to work around bugs in your Xvnc server. The bit
values supported for a particular release of \fBxrdp\fR(8) are documented in
\fBxrdp.ini\fR.

.TP
\fBcode\fR=\fI<number>\fR|\fI0\fR
Specifies the session type. The default, \fI0\fR, is Xvnc, \fI10\fR is
X11rdp, and \fI20\fR is Xorg with xorgxrdp modules.

.TP
\fBchansrvport\fR=\fBDISPLAY(\fR\fIn\fR\fB)\fR|\fI/path/to/domain-socket\fR
Asks xrdp to connect to a manually started \fBxrdp-chansrv\fR instance.
This can be useful if you wish to use to use xrdp to connect to a VNC session
which has been started other than by \fBxrdp-sesman\fR, as you can then make
use of \fBxrdp\-chansrv\fR facilities in the VNC session.

The first form of this setting is recommended, replacing \fIn\fR with the
X11 display number of the session.
